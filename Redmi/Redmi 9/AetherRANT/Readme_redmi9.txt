---------------------------------

Changelogs:
Main Camera is saturated. 
Changed Ultra-wide, depth and macro lenses to Pixel 2 XL model so it wouldn't turn black. 
Frames HDR+ Enhanced are in 48, so it will be more lighter but render the image longer. 
All lenses are in Exposure +2.
Slow - mo still doesn't work, so we will wait. (...use #session and find the working session. -WonITKorea)
