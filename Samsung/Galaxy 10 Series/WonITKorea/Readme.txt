Final Config-----------------------------------------
Device: Samsung 10 Series
Creator: WonITKorea

Changelogs:
+Increased Dehaze level for clear shots
+I think it doesn't have much Rainbow ring than any other 8.1 config I've made.
+Sharpening pattern in Dark area significantly reduced

-It is final, but there could be a fix if something broke.

Semi-Final------------------------------------------
Changelog:
 - Increased brightness to almost normal state
 - A bit more fixed Rainbow ring(in most occasions I guess, but please tell me if it's true.)
